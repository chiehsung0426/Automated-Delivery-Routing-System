# Automated Delivery Routing System

This project is a C/C++ implementation for managing and optimizing delivery truck routes, including shipment validation, truck space management, and mapping the most efficient delivery paths.

It integrates components such as:
- Shipment handling and validation
- Truck loading logic
- Mapping with route calculations
- Integration and unit testing using Visual Studio test framework

## 🛠 How to Build & Run

1️⃣ Open the `.sln` solution file in Visual Studio 2022.  
2️⃣ Build the solution (default: `Release` or `Debug` mode).  
3️⃣ Run the program:
- **Option 1**: Perform shipment handling — interactively enter shipment details and see routing.
- **Option 2**: Run integration tests to validate core features.
- **Option 0**: Exit the program.
